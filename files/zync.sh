## ZYNK: The Zuper Zimple ZFS Sync (Replication) Tool
## Form: zynk local/dataset root@remote.host destination/dataset

# Please note: The reason this is so simple is because there is no error checking, reporting, or cleanup.
#               In the event that something goes wonkey, you'll manually need to fix the snapshots and
#               modify or remote the /var/run/zynk datafile which contains the most recent snapshot name.
# Furthermore, this absolutely relies on the GNU version of 'date' in order to get epoch time
# Before using, make sure you've distributed your SSH key to the remote host and can ssh without password.
